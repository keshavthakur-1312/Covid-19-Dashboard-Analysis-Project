This project presents a detailed visual analysis of the Covid-19 pandemic in India using Tableau. The dashboard highlights key metrics such as statewise deaths, vaccination progress, testing data, age and gender distributions, and trends in confirmed and cured cases over time.

## üìä Dashboard Overview

The dashboard includes the following visualizations:

- **üó∫Ô∏è Total Deaths by State:** A color-coded map showing the severity of Covid-19 impact across Indian states. Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu report the highest death tolls.

  - Vaccine-wise distribution: CoviShield, Covaxin, and Sputnik V (note: values may need scaling adjustment).

- **üìã Statewise Testing Data:** Stacked bar chart showing total samples collected, along with positive and negative results by state.
